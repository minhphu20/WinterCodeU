# CodeU Project

## Chart Page:
- Go to http://localhost:8080/chart.html (if on local)
- You should see 2 charts:
  - Top one displays the number of messages posed each day
  - Bottom one shows the number of pet dogs per country for five countries with most dogs
- Try posting a message, and see that the top chart changes according!

## Server Side Rendering:
- User Page is now server-side rendered! The URL is for instance `/users/Ada` instead of `/user-page.html?user=Ada`!
